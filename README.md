# Notes

# Overview
In this project, I created a simple notes app with the purpose of just trying to create something functional and that could be used for your day to day use. This notes app, is pretty simple in design, it allows the user to add, edit and delete notes. The purpose of this app is to help the user record down notes for reminders, or just simply take a note of something important.
